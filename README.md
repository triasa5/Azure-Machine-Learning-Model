# Azure-Machine-Learning-Model
**Project title |** *Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning model*<br><br>
**Project description:**<br>
The core idea of this project is to utilise machine learning algorithm to solve the problem of predicting Health Insurance cost of a person based on certain data. The objective of this project is to build a prototype based on a machine learning model which is trained with people's data including age, Body Mass Index, smoker or not, etc. and uses linear regression method to predict the cost for an unknown set of data. The model is built using Azure Machine Learning pipelines and the rest api key of the model is used to fetch data from the model and display it to the client. The prototype is able to predict the cost efficiently based on peopleâ€™s data and this will help a lot of people to estimate the amount of money they will be paying for their insurance. The description given aligns with the built prototype.<br><br>
**Test:**<br>
For testing purpose, you can try out the following values<br>
Age: 19<br>
Gender: female<br>
BMI: 27.9<br>
Children: 0<br>
Smoker: yes<br>
Region: southwest<br>
And the cost should be 24967.95 USD<br><br>
